# Metro

This is the unity project for the Human-AI Teaming mini metro clone for VR.

## API

API Documentation is available in [API.md](https://github.com/xrdesign/Metro/blob/main/API.md).

## Getting Started

Install Unity, this project is using Unity version 2020.3.28f1.

To get started using this repo you will have to import the MRTK and Oculus Integration packages manually, as I didn't want to bloat the git repo with readily available packages.

### Import MRTK 

The project currently uses MRTK 2.8, 
Install the following packages into the Metro unity project directory:
- "com.microsoft.mixedreality.toolkit.extensions"
- "com.microsoft.mixedreality.toolkit.foundation"
- "com.microsoft.mixedreality.toolkit.standardassets"
- "com.microsoft.mixedreality.toolkit.testutilities"
- "com.microsoft.mixedreality.toolkit.tools"

#### Windows
To install use the microsoft feature tool:
[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/develop/unity/welcome-to-mr-feature-tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/develop/unity/welcome-to-mr-feature-tool)

#### Mac
MRTK packages can be directly downloaded from [https://github.com/microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/releases/](https://github.com/microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/releases/)

### Additional Steps

- Upgrad MRTK shaders for Universal Render Pipeline: click menu item "Mixed Reality > Toolkit > Utilities > Upgrade MRTK Standard Shader for Universal Render Pipeline"

- Open _Metro/Scenes/Metro.unity and select Import TMPro Essentials from the popup
