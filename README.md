# Metro

This is the unity project for the Human-AI Teaming mini metro clone for VR.

## API

API Documentation is available in [API.md](https://github.com/xrdesign/Metro/blob/main/API.md).

## Getting Started

Install Unity, this project is using Unity version 2020.3.28f1.

To get started using this repo you will have to import the MRTK and Oculus Integration packages manually, as I didn't want to bloat the git repo with readily available packages.

### Import MRTK 

The project currently uses MRTK 2.8, to install use the microsoft feature tool:

[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/develop/unity/welcome-to-mr-feature-tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/develop/unity/welcome-to-mr-feature-tool)

Install the following packages into the Metro unity project directory:
- "com.microsoft.mixedreality.toolkit.extensions"
- "com.microsoft.mixedreality.toolkit.foundation"
- "com.microsoft.mixedreality.toolkit.standardassets"
- "com.microsoft.mixedreality.toolkit.testutilities"
- "com.microsoft.mixedreality.toolkit.tools"


### Import Oculus Integration

The project currently uses Oculus Integration SDK v40.0, to install download from:

[https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/package/unity-integration/40.0](https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/package/unity-integration/40.0)

Open the Unity editor, import the Oculus Integration package by clicking the menu item "Assets > Import Package > Custom Package.." navigate to the downloaded SDK file.


### Additional Steps

- Run Oculus / MRTK integration: click menu item "Mixed Reality > Toolkit > Utilities > Oculus > Integrate Oculus Integration Unity Modules"

- Upgrad MRTK shaders for Universal Render Pipeline: click menu item "Mixed Reality > Toolkit > Utilities > Upgrade MRTK Standard Shader for Universal Render Pipeline"
